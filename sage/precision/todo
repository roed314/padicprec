(Relatively) small tasks:
-------------------------

* implement a specific base for precision (which can differ 
  from the base of the object itself)
  It could be useful for instance if we have to work at the
  same time with elements in Q_p and K (a finite extension
  of Q_p). Indeed, in this situation, it may make sense to
  use lattices defined over Z_p to handle precision of 
  elements in K
 
* init function in lazy

* implement a ModelPrecisionMode for conversion between 
  precision models.
  I see three modes: Standard, Increasing, Decreasing

* should we implement a special class for working_precision?
  can we reuse BigOh for this.

* find something better as limit_lazyprecision 


Big tasks
---------

* implement the precision mode "Collective"

* implement convergent series

* implement modules over Z_p and other rings
