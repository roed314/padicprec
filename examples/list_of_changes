We put out code on github and added a reference to it in the
introduction of the paper.

We clarified the definition of the "coordinate-wise method" (at
the beginning of section 2.1) and "lattice method" (just after
Proposition 2.1) for tracking p-adic precision.

We added some comments after Definition 2.3 in order to make
clear the relationship between the notion of diffused digits
of precision and the coordinate-wise precision data.

We clarified the statement of Proposition 3.1.

We added a remark at the end of Section 3.1 relating our work
to the theory of random walks on homogeneous spaces.

We fixed a mistake in Section 3.2 about the locus of diffe-
rentiability of the determinant.

We corrected typos pointed out by the reviewers and made some
small gramatical and stylistic changes.
