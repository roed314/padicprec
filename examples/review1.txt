This is an article about precision of p-adic computations in linear 
algebra.

The article is very well written, the topic is interesting; I found no 
technical error. My recommendation is to accept it for publication.

Lattice based p-adic precision methods are recalled in section 2, 
summarized and with extra precisions from a previous recent refereed 
article of the Authors. Section 3 is devoted to major linear algebra 
operations (MatMul, Det, CharPoly, LU). The results compare very 
favourably with the naive coordinate-wise method.

There are implementation results on random matrices. There is no link to 
check the code and using random matrices is certainly not a good choice.

Section 4, I don't really know about.

It is interesting (and very surprising) that these results seem not to 
depend on the algorithm used in Section 3
