This paper gives several applications of the theory for estimating 
precision under differential maps developed by the authors. But at least 
for me the description of this paper is too rough to understand the 
contents. The paper compares "standard coordinate-wise methods" and 
"lattice based method" for tracking precision in each application. 
However their meanings are not clearly given. It seems that the diffused 
digits of precision (Definition 2.3) is related to the coordinate-wise 
tracking of precision, but it is not clear for me. Also, the algorithms 
used for comparison are not clearly stated. For example, if the 
precision tracking by the lattice method is based on Prop3.1, then it 
seems that the Smith decompositions of A and B are necessary. If so, it 
is not a fair comparison because the comparison of time complexity is 
not given. As to Prop3.1, the proof of the second statement is not 
given. It should be given in the paper.
