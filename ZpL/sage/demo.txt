# ZpL: a p-adic precision package

%% markdown
### Legend
- _ZpCR_ stands for Capped Relative precision: this is roughly the analogue of interval arithmetic (a $p$-adic number is represented by a subset of the shape $x + O(p^n)$ and precision is tracked by operating of these subsets)
- _ZpFP_ stands for Floating Point arithmetic: this is the analogue of usual floating point arithmetic (just a certain subset of $p$-adic numbers are available and results are rounded so that they always lie in this subset)
- _ZpLP_ stands for Lattice Precision (our package)

### Creation of the rings

Z2 = Zp(2, prec=30, print_mode="digits")
Z3 = Zp(3, prec=20, print_mode="digits")

%% markdown
## First examples

x = random_element(Z3,5)
x

%% markdown
When we multiply by $p$, we gain one digit of absolute precision:

3*x

%% markdown
The ZpL package sees this gain of precision even if the computation is split into several steps:

x + x + x

y = 2*x
y

x + y

%% markdown
The same with multiplication:

x^3

x * x * x

y = x^2
y

x * y

%% markdown
## Computations with numbers at different precision

x = random_element(Z2,10)
y = random_element(Z2,5)

u = x+y
u

v = x-y
v

%% markdown
Now we compute $u + v$, which is also $2x$.
Here is what we get:

u+v

2*x

%% markdown
## The SOMOS 4 sequence

%% markdown
The SOMOS 4 sequence is the sequence defined by the recurrence
$$u_{n+4} = \frac{u_{n+1}u_{n+3} + u_{n+2}^2}{u_n}.$$
It turns out that its computation is highly unstable.  
For this reason, using the ZpL package can here be decisive.

def somos(u0, u1, u2, u3, n):
    a, b, c, d = u0, u1, u2, u3
    for _ in range(4, n+1):
        a, b, c, d = b, c, d, (b*d + c*c) / a
    return d

somos(Z2(1,15), Z2(1,15), Z2(1,15), Z2(3,15), 18)

somos(Z2(1,15), Z2(1,15), Z2(1,15), Z2(3,15), 100)

%% markdown
## Computations with matrices

D = diagonal_matrix([ Z3(1,5), Z3(9,5), Z3(27,5), Z3(81,5) ])
D

%% markdown
The determinant of $D$ is known at higher precision.
This is due to the particular shape of $D$.

D.determinant()

%% markdown
This phenomenon is preserved when $D$ is modified by (left and right) multiplication by some matrix.
However the software may or may not see it, depending on the method it uses for tracking precision

MS = D.parent()
P = random_element(MS, prec=5)
Q = random_element(MS, prec=5)
M = P*D*Q
M

M.determinant()

P.determinant() * D.determinant() * Q.determinant()

%% markdown
Notice that ZpCR cannot decide whether the determinant $M$ vanishes.
This may have important consequences if, at some point, we will test if $M$ is invertible or not and jump to one branch or another one depending on the result.

M.charpoly()

%% markdown
## Computations with polynomials

S.<x> = PolynomialRing(Z2)
P = random_element(S, degree=10, prec=5)
Q = random_element(S, degree=10, prec=5)
D = x^5 + random_element(S, degree=4, prec=8)
D

%% markdown
With high probability, $P$ and $Q$ are coprime, implying that the gcd of $DP$ is $DQ$ is $D$.  
However, we observe that we do not always get this expected result:

def euclidean(A,B):
    while B != 0:
        A, B = B, A % B
    return A.monic()

euclidean(D*P, D*Q)

%% markdown
More precisely, ZpCR often found a gcd of higher degree.
Indeed the Euclidean algorithm stops prematurely because the software believes that some early remainder vanishes due to the lack of precision.  
The situation with ZpFP is the exact opposite:
since the precision is too high (always the maximal cap), the software does not notice that the remainder vanishes. Therefore the Euclidean algorithm does not stop until it obtains a remainder of degree $0$.
